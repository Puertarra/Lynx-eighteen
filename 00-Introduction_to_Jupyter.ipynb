    "\n",
    "Second, the core programming languages supported by Jupyter are Julia, Python and R. While the name Jupyter is not a direct acronym for these languages, it nods its head in those directions. In particular, the \"y\" in the middle of Jupyter was chosen to honor our Python heritage. See the logos of these languages in the languages folder of this repo.\n",

    "Third, Galileo was the first person to discover the moons of Jupiter. His publication on the moons of Jupiter is an early example of research that includes the underlying data in the publication. This is one of the core ideas and requirements for scientific reproducibility. Reproducibility is one of the main focuses of our project."
